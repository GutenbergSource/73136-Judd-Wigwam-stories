<HTML><BODY><p>A neatly illustrated compilation of stories by or about American Indians for children. Fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>At the end is a pronunciation guide with some odd characters. I have added the special characters to the custom picker, but some of these need to be typed in with the old-fashioned notation, as they do not exist as single characters in Unicode. That is: [a:] for a with diaeresis below, [a(] for a with a bow below, [s+] for a s with a turned T below, [=oo] for a double o with a macron, and [)oo] for a double o with a breve. </p>
<p>Have fun!</p></BODY></HTML>
